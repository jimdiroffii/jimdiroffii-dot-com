			Day 3 was a little less productive for coding. I mostly did
			administrative work to start the day. Working with docker,
			working with shells, updating PCs, synchronizing files, etc. I
			wanted to add another project to my Laravel tutorial. I
			have been wanting a personal management system for a long time.
			The only one I know of that exists is called Monica. It was ok,
			and did what I needed it to do on a basic level. However, I was
			not a fan of the interface. The developers were also not working
			on the application full-time, while trying to migrate the entire
			system over to a new version called Chandler. They have put in
			a tremendous effort, but I think I can make one on my own.
		</p>

			I successfully containerized my PHP Time Tracker today, transforming
			it from a simple local script into a portable Docker application.
			The process involved more than just writing a `Dockerfile`; I had to
			solve a common persistence challenge where the container’s web user
			(`www-data`) lacked permission to write to the SQLite database on my
			host machine. Instead of using an insecure workaround like `chmod
			777`, I re-architected the deployment to separate code from data: I
			modified the PHP connection logic to respect environment variables
			and configured `docker-compose` to store the database in a
			dedicated, named volume. This approach allowed me to mount the
			application code as read-only for better security while ensuring my
			data persists safely in a managed volume with the correct ownership
			permissions. There still exists a bug in the Unraid docker
			configuration which will delete the database if the container is
			updated. This is due to the database not being stored in a
			persistent share, but inside the container itself. I'll have to fix
			it later, as it works for now.
		</p>

			When I switched my Debian default shell from bash to zsh, I
			discovered my old `.bashrc` habit of starting `ssh-agent` and
			running `ssh-add` didn’t behave the same in `.zshrc`: zsh would
			finish drawing the prompt and then ask for the key passphrase a
			moment later, but the passphrase would consistently “fail” even
			though it worked fine if I skipped it and ran `ssh-add` manually
			afterward (or via bash). The root cause is timing/TTY
			handling—`.zshrc` runs during interactive shell initialization, and
			`ssh-add` can end up reading from a non-TTY or otherwise confused
			stdin while zsh is setting up the prompt, so the passphrase input
			isn’t captured correctly. The fix is to move agent/key setup out of
			`.zshrc` and into `.zprofile` (login-shell init for SSH sessions),
			and explicitly force `ssh-add` to read from the real terminal (e.g.,
			`ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa &lt;/dev/tty`) after ensuring an agent
			exists, which makes the passphrase prompt immediate and reliable
			again.
		</p>
		<p>
			Looking at my Personal Management System website, this is going to
			take a bit more thought. With my client website, I know what I want
			to build because they already have a website. The PMS site is
			something novel and new. I should spend a little bit of time
			designing what I want, but I kind of just want to ram through it. I
			generated a new Laravel site.
