			More administration work today. I needed a new webserver, as my old
			AWS server was deleted because I accidentally left it as a spot
			instance. I started a new DigitalOcean server to give their service
			a fair shot. This lead me to setting up a private instance of Gitea
			on my local server to start a repo for server configurations that I
			do not want to post on the public internet (Github). That further
			led me down a rabbit hole where I found out my development server
			could not see any Tailscale machines due to a DNS issue. Once again,
			none of this is technically code, so I need to find something else
			to work on. I'm already a few days out from the last time I worked
			on my Laravel tutorial, and associated sites, so I need to get
			cranking on that. First, I need to get my new Personal Relationship
			Manager repo up to date.
		</p>
		<p>
			The DigitalOcean server is running Ubuntu, and before I install any
			production software, I need to go through some hardening steps.
			Preventing root user login, setting up new users, enabling firewall
			rules, fail2ban configuration, software removal, and more.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Gitea setup was pretty smooth. I used the container version,
			which I hosted on Unraid. The UI is practically identical to Github,
			so onboarding was quick and easy. I also setup mirroring for all my
			Github repos, so I have another copy that automatically updates.
		</p>
		<p>
			My DNS issue was annoying but ultimately pretty simple to fix. The
			issue was that resolv.conf was being fought over by dhcpd and
			Tailscale, and dhcpd was always winning the fight. I had to add
			`nohook resolv.conf` to my dhcpcd.conf configuration, which resolved
			the issue.
		</p>
		<p>
			Writing up all of these articles into HTML is not a very fun
			experience. I much prefer writing in Markdown, and Markdown also
			gives me the option to migrate to a different platform quite easily
			without changing my writing style or posts. I have changed this so
			many times, from Wordpress to Astro to 11ty to something else I
			can't even remember. Today, I was looking at Ghost and Hugo. I
			really like static sites for type of content. It is fast and easy. I
			think I'm going to go with Hugo.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we can call it code, I wrote some Markdown today. I created a
			readme for the PRM repo, so that I could know where to start with
			the Laravel configuration. I installed the LiveWire starter
			template, which enabled a number of things, including
			authentication, but I need to review all of the code generated
			before I can really begin making edits. The readme file structures
			the first steps needed to get the application up and running with a
			MVP alpha build.
