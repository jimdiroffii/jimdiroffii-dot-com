                The second day of coding went fairly productive. I worked on the
                Laravel From Scratch 2026 series, a new vimrc file, a prototype
                website for a client, and vibecoded a PHP time tracker.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Laracasts tutorial on Laravel lead me through setting
                up basic views and routes. I've done the tutorial before, but 
                it was on a previous version of Laravel and over a year ago. The
                other issue with doing tutorials is not translating that knowledge
                directly into a more complex project. This directly lead me into 
                two additional projects, vimrc and a client website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vimrc file is a configuration file for vim. I've preferred
                using vim for a long time, but I've never tried to really use 
                it for development. Watching people who are quick with vim and 
                emacs is quite extraordinary, and I wanted that quickness. After
                some evaluation, I decided to skip emacs, and stick with vim. 
                Most IDEs support vim motions, and vi or vim is available on 
                most machines. Setting up the vimrc file allowed me to configure
                a number of default options, such as line numbers and relative
                line numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The client project is something I've sent a contract out to them
                for development. The contract wasn't approved, but I'm not giving
                up. I wanted the business, but don't believe my salesmanship was
                truly up to the standards necessary. I do believe that I can 
                develop a truly impressive website that can help their business.
                Therefore, I'm using the Laracasts tutorial to help guide me 
                through the development of the core site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, I ended the programming day by essentially vibe coding
                a working time tracker using PHP. I technically didn't "vibe" 
                code the site, as I didn't use voice, and copied all the code 
                manually. I've used Toggl for a long time to track time across
                different projects when needed. But, Toggl costs money, and it
                is just a time tracker. I decided I can get the core functionality
                I needed from a custom coded application. It can be found at
                <a href="https://github.com/jimdiroffii/time-tracker">Time Tracker</a>.
