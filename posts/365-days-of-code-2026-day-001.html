        <h1>365 Days of Code - 2026</h1>
        <h2>Day 001</h2>
        <p>
            The goal of this challenge is pretty obvious; code every day for a
            year. I didn't necessarily want to start on the first of the year,
            as I didn't want the gimmick of a "New Year's Resolution." I wanted
            this challenge to stick. I've always enjoyed coding and programming,
            but I've never stuck with it in long enough stretches to become
            truly good. Challenging myself to code everyday for a year should
            hopefully help me get into the habit.
        </p>

            I have more than a few different projects that I want to work on.
            Most of them are web apps, but I'd like to get some system software
            engineering with C, C++, Rust, Python, Java and Go into the mix. In
            the interest of getting started, I'll stick with the web technology.
            HTML and CSS are hardly "programming," but I still consider them to
            be "code." I'll get into some PHP and JavaScript as well.
        </p>

            While not strictly programming or coding, writing up this blog post
            is my first day. My goal for my personal website is to be pure HTML
            and CSS, no JavaScript or frameworks. I like the simplicity of it,
            and don't really care to deal with cookies, analytics, or other
            advanced functionality. The objective is only the free exchange of
            information. By not including JavaScript, I'm helping to ensure these
            posts can reach the widest possible audience.
