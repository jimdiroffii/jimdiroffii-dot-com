I am a seasoned system administrator and general technologist with over 16 years of professional IT experience, making me a strong candidate for managing complex enterprise infrastructure. I offer a blend of deep operational knowledge and a "security-first" mindset, having recently earned a CompTIA Security+ certification and possessing experience with offensive security research to better defend systems.

**Enterprise Scale and Reliability**
I have a proven track record in high-stakes, mission-critical environments suitable for a large company. While at Areas USA, I managed the IT infrastructure for over 160 locations nationwide, supporting systems that processed hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. I led a major transition from multiple legacy vendors to a single unified cloud solution, which eliminated vendor support costs and reduced the time required to develop new operations centers by 93%. I am accustomed to providing 24/7 mission-critical support and maintaining high availability in time-sensitive environments.

**Technical Proficiency and Automation**
I have extensive hands-on experience across a wide technical stack relevant to system administration:

- **Operating Systems & Virtualization:** I am adept at administering Windows Server (2008–2022) and Linux (Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu) environments, as well as managing virtualization through VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, and Docker.

- **Cloud & Identity:** My background includes administering AWS services (EC2, VPC, IAM) and building secure identity environments using Azure AD (Entra ID) and GovCloud.

- **Automation:** To reduce operational toil, I utilize scripting languages such as PowerShell, Bash, and Python to automate maintenance processes, system provisioning, and reporting.

**Security and Compliance**
I am highly experienced in designing infrastructure that meets rigorous regulatory standards, a critical requirement for large enterprises. I have architected and maintained networks compliant with NIST 800-171 and CMMC standards for government defense subcontractors. Additionally, I have managed PCI-DSS compliance programs for national retail clients, implementing secure network designs and vulnerability management.

**Leadership and Soft Skills**
Beyond technical execution, I create value through leadership and communication. I have mentored junior technical staff, trained hundreds of associates, and authored comprehensive technical and user documentation. I describe myself as a "motivated philomath" committed to continuous learning, evidenced by my recent completion of advanced certificates in C++ and Java programming.
