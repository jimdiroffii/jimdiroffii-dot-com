Hello, world! I’m Jim, owner at Diroff Technology Consulting. I'm a technology consultant, developer, and lifelong generalist with an insatiable curiosity. I’ve led large-scale rollouts and supported organizations with everything from infrastructure hardening, point of sale, incident-ready logging, and standards compliance. I prefer simplicity over complexity, clear ownership, and complete documentation. I really enjoy solving problems and mapping complex requirements to simple solutions.
