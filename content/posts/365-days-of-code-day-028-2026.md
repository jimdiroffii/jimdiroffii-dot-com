I'm going to have to keep track of projects on every post, since I seem to keep going in different directions every day. Today's work was mostly for a client compliance project. Everything except for code. Here are the projects I am currently tracking, in no particular order:

This was a good exercise. It shows why it is hard to get anything truly done. This isn't even _everything_ that I've worked on, only stuff that is either programming or programming-adjacent. I'm spreading myself too thin. On top of these projects, I still have real-life stuff to do.
