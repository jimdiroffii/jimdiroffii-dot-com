The goal of this challenge is pretty obvious; code every day for a year. I didn't necessarily want to start on the first of the year, as I didn't want the gimmick of a *New Year's Resolution* and I wanted this challenge to stick. I've always enjoyed coding and programming, but I've never stuck with it in long enough stretches to become truly good. Challenging myself to code everyday for a year should hopefully help me get into the habit.

I have more than a few different projects that I want to work on. Most of them are web apps, but I'd like to get some system software engineering with C, C++, Rust, Python, Java and Go into the mix. In the interest of getting started, I'll stick with the web technology. HTML and CSS are hardly *programming*, so I'll get into some PHP and JavaScript as well.

While also not strictly programming, writing up this blog post is my first day. My goal for my personal website is to be pure HTML and CSS, no JavaScript or frameworks. I like the simplicity of it, and don't really care to deal with cookies, analytics, or other advanced functionality. The objective is only the free exchange of information. By not including JavaScript, I'm helping to ensure these posts can reach the widest possible audience.
