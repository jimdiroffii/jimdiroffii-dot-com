## Minor Hugo Work

Kept things pretty light today due to personal obligations.

First thing done, setup the RSS links for the articles.

- `head.html`

```go
{{/* RSS */}}
{{ with .OutputFormats.Get "rss" }}
  {{ printf `<link rel=%q type=%q href=%q title=%q>` .Rel .MediaType.Type .Permalink site.Title | safeHTML }}
{{ end }}
```

Secondly, setup the `robots.txt` template.

- `hugo.toml`

```toml
enableRobotsTXT = true
```

- `head.html`

```html
<meta name="robots" content="follow, index" />
```
