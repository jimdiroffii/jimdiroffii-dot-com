The new site is ready to go live. I moved over a bunch of blog posts, added an automatic summary for markdown files, and cleaned up some CSS. Today is much more administration than code, but I'm counting it all. And, now that I've finally finished working on my new site, I can move forward with my other code projects. Doing the daily write-ups will be much easier.

As a reminder, all commits can be found on the [Github repo](https://github.com/jimdiroffii/jimdiroffii-dot-com/) for this site.
