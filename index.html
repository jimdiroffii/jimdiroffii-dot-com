            <h2>The Origin</h2>
            <p>
                My curiosity started around 1989. I grew up pulling things apart: computers, networks, and anything
                that had signals, moving parts, or hidden complexity. I'm happiest when I can trace a problem to its
                root cause — down to packets, logs, timing, and constraints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time that curiosity turned into a career: enterprise infrastructure, point-of-sale ecosystems,
                and consulting work where “it has to work everywhere, every day” is the baseline — not the goal.
            </p>

            <div class="callout">
                <p>
                    <strong>Principle:</strong> If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it well enough.
                </p>

            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <p>
                I build and harden systems for organizations that need real-world reliability — not demo-ware.
                That usually means secure configuration, practical monitoring, migration planning, and automation that
                keeps things boring (in the best way).
            </p>

            <ul class="bullets">
                <li><strong>Security hardening</strong> for servers, networks, and applications — with clear
                    documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure engineering</strong>: Linux, web hosting, DNS, identity, and “it all
                    connects” troubleshooting.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation</strong> that removes repeated manual work (and makes the remaining work
                    auditable).</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance support</strong> (e.g., NIST-style thinking): controls, evidence, and pragmatic
                    implementation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="small">
                I also like writing internal runbooks, because the only thing worse than a fragile system is a fragile
                system nobody can operate.

            <h2>The Lab</h2>
            <p>
                Side projects are where I go deeper: networking, security research, performance tuning, and space
                systems
                concepts. I'm not chasing novelty — I'm chasing understanding.

                    under real program constraints.

                <li>
                    <strong>CTF / security research tooling:</strong>
                    Python-first scripts that interrogate APIs, validate assumptions, and reduce noisy workflows to
                    repeatable steps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Minimal web stack:</strong>

                I prefer tools that are durable, inspectable, and under your control. I'll happily trade trends for
                stability and debuggability.

            <h2>The Now</h2>
            <p>
                Right now I'm building a minimalist personal site, continuing security work, and refining a long-term
                personal toolkit: better automation, better documentation, and better systems thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm also constantly learning — from low-level networking to space systems constraints — because the fun
                part
                is connecting the pieces.
